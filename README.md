### Creating Slash Commands

When adding a new command make sure to run `bun register` to register the command!
<br/>
Restart your discord to get refresh the commands after the register script has completed.

Be aware that if `isDevelopment` is set to true then the command will only show up in the development server that was configured in the `.env` file.

The following shows you how to create a simple command that replies with a message (and using translations).

```ts
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { t } from 'i18next';

import { Command } from 'classes/base/command';

export default new Command({
  // Will only be deployed to dev server and only usable by developer
  isDevelopment: true,
  // 3 seconds cooldown
  cooldown: 3000,
  // Permissions the bot needs to execute the command
  botPermissions: ['SendMessages'],
  // Command name, description and options
  // Name must be lowercase and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores
  builder: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('repeat')
    .setDescription('Replies with whatever you say!')
    .addStringOption((option) =>
      option
        .setName('text')
        .setDescription('The text to repeat') /*.setRequired(true)*/
        .setAutocomplete(true),
    ),
  autocomplete(interaction) {
    const focusedOption = interaction.options.getFocused();

    // Check if the focused option is the option we want to autocomplete
    if (focusedOption.name === 'text') {
      // Example choices for autocomplete
      const choices = ['Hello World', 'Test', 'Repeat after me'];
      // Filter the choices based on the user input
      const filtered = choices.filter((choice) => choice.toLowerCase().includes(focusedOption.value.toLowerCase()));

      // Discord's limit for autocomplete choices is 25
      const sliced = filtered.slice(0, 25);

      interaction.respond(sliced.map((choice) => ({ name: choice, value: choice })));
    }
  },
  execute(interaction) {
    // Get the text option from the interaction
    const text = interaction.options.getString('text');

    // This is just an example, you can do whatever you want with the text

    // Reply with the text the user provided
    // If the user didn't provide any text, we can just say "nothing"
    interaction.reply({
      content: t('repeat.reply', { lng: interaction.locale, text: text ?? t('repeat.nothing', { lng: interaction.locale }) }),
    });
  },
});
```

### Message Translation

```json
{
  "repeat": {
    "reply": "You said: {{text}}",
    "nothing": "nothing!"
  }
}
```

Example outputs with the inputs of `test` and _no input_ would be:

```
You said: test
You said: nothing!
```

### Command translation

```json
{
  "repeat": {
    "name": "repeat",
    "description": "Replies with whatever you say!",
    "options": [
      {
        "name": "text",
        "description": "The text to repeat"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
